## About

This repository is my first "hello world" project on GitHub. It's primarily a learning repository where I practice repository workflows, commits, and basic Markdown.

## Why I created this

- To learn how to create and manage repositories on GitHub.
- To practice using commits, branches, and pull requests.
- To learn how to write a README and document a project.

## Resources

- Learn GitHub: Microsoft Learn — https://learn.microsoft.com/nl-nl/training/github/

## How to use

There is no executable code in this repository — it's for learning. If you want to view or edit the README:

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/ITsReijt/hello-world.git

2. Open README.md in your editor and edit or practice making commits.

## Contributing

I welcome suggestions! If you'd like to suggest improvements to this README or the repository structure:

- Open an issue describing your suggestion.
- Optionally, open a pull request with the proposed changes.

## What I plan next

- Add a small sample script (Hello World in multiple languages).
- Add examples and a CONTRIBUTING.md to practice PR workflow.

## License & Contact

This repository is for learning and contains no code with licensing concerns. If you want to contact me, open an issue or reach out via my GitHub profile: https://github.com/ITsReijt
